## 📂 Projects

### 1️⃣ Infrastructure as Code: Terraform Local File Project”
This project automates the creation of a simple `hello.txt` file on my local system using Terraform’s `local_file` provider. While it’s a small output, the purpose is to understand **how Terraform works**, from writing `.tf` files to executing `terraform apply`.
